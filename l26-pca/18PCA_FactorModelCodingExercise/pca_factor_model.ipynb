    "\n",
    "As we learned in the previous lessons, we can use PCA to create a factor model of risk. Our risk factor model represents the return as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{r} = \\textbf{B}\\textbf{f} + \\textbf{s}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\textbf{r}$ is a matrix containing the asset returns, $\\textbf{B}$ is a matrix representing the factor exposures, $\\textbf{f}$ is the matrix of factor returns, and $\\textbf{s}$ is the idiosyncratic risk (also known as the company specific risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use real stock data to calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Factor Exposures (Factor Betas) $\\textbf{B}$\n",
    "* The Factor Returns $\\textbf{f}$\n",
    "* The Idiosyncratic Risk Matrix $\\textbf{S}$\n",
    "* The Factor Covariance Matrix $\\textbf{F}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then combine these quantities to create our Risk Model. "
